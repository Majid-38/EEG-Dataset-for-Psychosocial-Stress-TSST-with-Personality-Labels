Title: EEG Dataset for Psychosocial Stress (TSST) with Personality Labels
Subjects: 19 participants
Experimental Phases:

Baseline (pre-stress resting state)

Mental Arithmetic Task (stress induction)

Job Interview (social-evaluative stress)

Recovery Period (post-stress resting state)

Key Features
EEG Signals:

Recorded during all four TSST phases.

Personality labels included for correlational analysis.

Technical Specifications:

Sampling Rate: 1024 Hz

A/D Conversion: 24-bit resolution

Electrodes: 64 Ag/AgCl scalp channels arranged in the 10-20 international system.

Data Processing Pipeline
Preprocessing:

Raw EEG signals digitized and stored for analysis.

Spectral Analysis:

Power Spectral Density (PSD): Computed using the Welch method with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

Segmentation: 1024-sample windows with 50% overlap for robust frequency resolution.

Frequency Bands:

Delta (1–4 Hz)

Theta (4–8 Hz)

Alpha (8–12 Hz)

Beta (12–30 Hz)

Gamma (30–45 Hz)
